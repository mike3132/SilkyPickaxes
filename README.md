This plugin changes nothing about the actual spawner
It simply adds a permission attachment to players when they break a spawner
And then Rosestacker handles the breaking and manipulating of the spawner block

You must have the following set in Rosestacker's config.yml file
# silk-touch-advanced-permissions: true
# silk-touch-required: true

To find these use Ctrl+f and search for "silk-touch-advanced-permissions" and "silk-touch-required"
